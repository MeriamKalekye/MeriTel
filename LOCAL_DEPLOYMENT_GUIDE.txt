================================================================================

QUICK START (For Non-Technical Users)
--------------------------------------
1. Double-click "START_MERITEL.bat"
2. Wait 30-60 seconds for the browser to open automatically
3. Start using MeriTel at http://localhost:3000
4. To stop: Double-click "STOP_MERITEL.bat" or close both command windows


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
- Windows 10/11
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 16 or higher
- Internet connection (for ML APIs)
- Microphone (for recording physical meetings)


FIRST-TIME SETUP
----------------
Before running MeriTel for the first time:

1. Install Prerequisites:
   - Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
     (Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation)
   
   - Node.js: https://nodejs.org/
     (Download LTS version)

2. Configure API Keys:
   - Open "backend/.env" file with Notepad
   - Add your API keys (provided separately):
     * ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
     * DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here

3. Run START_MERITEL.bat (first run may take 5-10 minutes)


DAILY USAGE
-----------
1. Starting MeriTel:
   - Double-click START_MERITEL.bat
   - Wait for browser to open
   - Two command windows will appear (don't close them!)

2. Recording Meetings:
   Physical Meeting:
   - Click "Physical Meeting" on homepage
   - Choose "Record Now" or "Upload Recording"
   - Click "Transcribe" after recording/uploading
   - Click "Generate Summary" after transcription

   Online Meeting:
   - Click "Online Meeting" on homepage
   - Enter Google Meet URL
   - Bot joins automatically and records
   - Click "Transcribe" and "Generate Summary" when done

3. Stopping MeriTel:
   - Option A: Double-click STOP_MERITEL.bat
   - Option B: Close both command windows (Backend & Frontend)


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Problem: "Python is not installed"
Solution: Install Python from python.org and check "Add to PATH"

Problem: "Node.js is not installed"
Solution: Install Node.js from nodejs.org

Problem: Frontend won't start / stuck loading
Solution: 
  1. Run STOP_MERITEL.bat
  2. Delete folder: frontend/node_modules
  3. Run START_MERITEL.bat again

Problem: "API key not configured" error
Solution: Edit backend/.env and add missing API keys

Problem: Echo in online meetings
Solution: Echo reduction is automatically applied for online meetings.
          If still present, try:
          - Use physical meeting mode instead
          - Ask participants to use headphones
          - Use native Zoom/Meet recording (upload method)

Problem: Port already in use
Solution: Run STOP_MERITEL.bat, wait 10 seconds, then START_MERITEL.bat

Problem: Can't access from other computers
Solution: This local deployment only works on the same computer.
          For network access, cloud deployment is required.


DATA STORAGE
------------
All meeting data is stored locally in:
  backend/data/
    - meetings/    (meeting metadata)
    - recordings/  (audio files)
    - transcripts/ (transcription data)
    - summaries/   (AI-generated summaries)

To backup: Copy entire backend/data/ folder

To delete all meetings: Delete contents of backend/data/ folders
  (keep the folders themselves, only delete files inside)


PERFORMANCE TIPS
----------------
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Restart MeriTel if it becomes slow (STOP → START)
- Large audio files (>100MB) may take longer to process
- Allow 1-2 minutes for transcription of 30-minute meetings
- Summaries generate in 5-10 seconds


API COSTS (For Reference)
--------------------------
AssemblyAI (Transcription): ~$0.0075 per 30-min meeting
DeepSeek (Summarization):   ~$0.001 per meeting
Total per meeting:          ~$0.01 (1 cent)

For 100 meetings/month:     ~$1/month in API costs


SECURITY NOTES
--------------
- API keys are stored in backend/.env (keep this file private)
- Meeting data stays on your computer (not sent to cloud)
- Only audio files are sent to transcription APIs
- No user data is collected or shared
